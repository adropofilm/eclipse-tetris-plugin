# eclipse-tetris-plugin
An eclipse plugin developed for my CS490MT course to highlight use of extensions and extension points in eclipse.

This assignment is about Eclipse plug-ins, and the extension and extension point mechanisms. The source code of the Java application is provided. The task was to change it to an Eclipse plug-in based application. The final outcome meets the following requirements:
        1. Final product is an Eclipse plug-in(s), and can be deployed as Eclipse plug-in(s).
        2. At least three Eclipse plug-ins are created in the system, and they are integrated through Eclipse extension points and extensions.
        3. At least one plug-in extension point was created in the system.
        4. At least two extensions were made to the extension point that was created.
